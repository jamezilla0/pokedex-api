# pokedex-api
Pokedex API written in Node, Express and MongoDB (mongoose). Served by Nginx and powered by Docker containers.

Data is imported from the [`metaunicorn/pokedex-data`](https://github.com/metaunicorn/pokedex-data) project.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS (with wget and unzip)
- Docker (1.12.5 or greater)

## Getting Started

Once you have Docker installed in your machine, you only need to build and start the docker containers
by running `docker/bin/build` inside the project folder.

This will expose the API under the [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) URL by default.
It needs the port 80 free in your host OS, in case it is not free, you can change it
in the `PK_HTTP_PORT` variable of the `.env` file.

IMPORTANT: don't run `npm install` from your host machine, use `docker/bin/pm install` instead, otherwise
OS-specific package bindings and binaries may not work in the docker image.

## Default URLs

- API: [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
- DB Management: [http://localhost:29019/](http://localhost:29019/)


## API Reference

All API endpoints are read-only and use the `GET` HTTP Method.
